To start a local HTTP server via terminal, navigate to the directory in which the project is located, open the terminal there and type in the following command: "$ python3 -m http.server 9000" or "$ ruby -run -ehttpd . -p9000".
Now a live HTTP server is running on local host on 0.0.0.0 port 9000. Therefore, to open the project in your web browser simply type in: "http://localhost:9000/".
Note that it is possible to change the port you want the server to be running on simply by changing the 9000 in the command with the port you want.
